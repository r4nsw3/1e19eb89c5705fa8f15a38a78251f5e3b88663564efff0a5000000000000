  |   Harness the AeternoBlade - and defy the abyss in this sequel to the   |
  |   fast-paced action/puzzle platformer. In AeternoBlade II, use the      |
  |   power of time itself to outwit your enemies and explore mysterious    |
  |   new dimensions. Jump between frenetic combat encounters and           |
  |   intriguing puzzle segments that require ingenious use of time.        |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Freyja, and newcomers Felix and Bernard, as they journey across       |
  |   dimensions in a desperate struggle against the destruction of the     |
  |   Dark Abyss. The power of the AeternoBlade must be returned or         |
  |   reality, as they know it, will face total collapse.                   |
  |                                                                         |

  |   relentless combos. Agile attack movements and the power of time are   |
  |   at your disposal in visually-striking, rapid combat. With both        |
  |   classic side-scrolling fights and the new addition of full-3D         |
  |   scenarios, launch enemies into the air and finish them using sword    |
  |   strikes, dashes and impressive ultimate attacks.                      |

  |   Manipulate time, eliminate enemies - and overcome all obstacles.      |
  |   Use techniques, such as Time Stop, Warp, and Reversal to outwit       |
  |   powerful bosses and solve creative puzzles.                           |
